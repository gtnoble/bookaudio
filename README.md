# 	Bookaudio - An audiobook scraper for bookaudio.online

## Introduction
Bookaudio.online is a great place to stream audiobooks, but there are no direct download links. Inspecting the page source revealed that the streaming app was sourcing from mp3 files stored under randomly generated names. I wrote bookaudio to access and retrieve these files automatically using a command line interface.
